        Hello, my name is Nathan but I like to go by Nate. \n\n
        I\'m 29 years old and live in Federal Way, WA.  I\'m a Computer Science graduate from
        the University of Washington, Tacoma and am recently working my first professional job
        in this field as a technical project manager at TecAce Software Ltd. \n\n
        When I am not working, I very much enjoy an active and healthy lifestyle through weight
        training and sports such as tennis and football.  I like to go on walks, play with my dog,
        listen to music, watch anime, and hang out with close friends.  Although I love being active,
        I am also very much a homebody and enjoy being a couch potato too.
